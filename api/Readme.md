npm i -D @types/node @types/express need to install for using TS
-D (or --save-dev): This flag specifies that the packages should be installed as development dependencies. Development dependencies are packages that are only required during the development and testing phase of a project, not during production.

@types/node: This package contains TypeScript type definitions for the Node.js runtime and its core modules. Installing @types/node allows you to write TypeScript code that uses Node.js-specific features and have the necessary type checking and autocompletion support.

@types/express: This package contains TypeScript type definitions for the Express.js framework. By installing @types/express, you enable TypeScript to understand and validate Express.js-specific syntax, methods, and types, providing better development experience and catching potential errors.
